Simulation and URDF/Mujoco
=========================

Model files for the Tilburg Hand are available in both **urdf** and **Mujoco** format, to make it easier to use them in a wide range of simulation software.
The files are included in the `src/tilburg_hand_urdf_mujoco` subfolder, as `robot.urdf` and `robot.xml`. The stl files are included in the same directory.
